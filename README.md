# The Odin Recipe Project

This project gave me a chance to step back from advanced concepts and reconnect with the basics. Following the Odin Project up to this point has been a rewarding experience—each lesson has either refreshed my memory or offered a new perspective.

## Focus on Commit Messages

One key focus during this project was improving my commit messages. Previously, I relied on GitHub Copilot, and the results weren’t always ideal. Thanks to the lesson on writing effective commits, I realized the importance of clarity and consistency.

Here are the practices I followed:

- Capitalized subject lines and limited them to 50 characters
- Avoided ending subjects with periods
- Used the imperative mood
- Separated subject from body with a blank line
- Wrapped body text at 72 characters
- Ensured the body explained _what_ changed and _why_

This small shift improved the quality of my commits and made my Git history easier to read and understand.
